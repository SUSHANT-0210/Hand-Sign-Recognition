# Hand Gesture Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Objective
The objective of this mini-project is to develop Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models capable of accurately classifying sign language letters based on image inputs. By training neural networks on a dataset of sign language gestures, the models will aim to recognize and classify hand gestures into their corresponding letters.

## Background
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by moving the hands combined with facial expressions and postures of the body. It is the primary language of many deaf North Americans, and one of several communication options available to deaf people.

Sign language is a vital mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automating the recognition of sign language gestures can aid in improving communication accessibility. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising results in image classification tasks and are well-suited for recognizing hand gestures in sign language.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale images of hand gestures representing sign language letters. Each image is of size 28X28 pixels, and the dataset includes labeled examples for training and testing.

- **Features**: Input Image: Grayscale images of hand gestures representing sign language letters.
- **Target Variable**: The target variable is the class label corresponding to the sign language letter depicted in the input image.

## Model Architecture
The project requires building a CNN architecture with the following structure:

1. **First Convolutional Layer**: Applies a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input data, extracting features like edges, textures, or patterns.
2. **Second Convolutional Layer**: Applies another set of learnable filters to the feature maps generated by the first layer, capturing more abstract and higher-level features.
3. **Activation Function**: ReLU activation function is applied after each convolutional layer to introduce non-linearity.
4. **Max Pooling Layer**: Down-samples the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, reducing their spatial dimensions and retaining the most important features.
5. **Fully Connected Layer**: The hierarchical representation from the convolutional layers is flattened and fed into one or more fully connected (dense) layers for final classification.
6. **Dropout Layer**: A dropout layer with a rate of 0.2 is used after the fully connected layer to prevent overfitting.
7. **Output Layer**: The output layer has 26 nodes, one for each class (letter).

## Model Visualization
A visual representation of the model architecture should be provided to illustrate the data flow through the layers.

## Model Training
1. **Compilation**: The model should be compiled using the Adam optimizer.
2. **Training**: Train the model for 10 epochs.
3. **Evaluation**: Monitor changes in loss and testing accuracy for each epoch, and plot the results.
4. **Results**: Analyze the variations in loss and testing accuracy over epochs to assess model performance.

## Observations
- Write observations on overfitting issues in this project and how the CNN handles this issue.
- Discuss whether overfitting will further reduce if another dropout layer (e.g., with a rate of 0.3) is used after the convolutional layers.
- Explain how the project has handled the share structure property and invariance property for the image classification task.

## Success Metrics
The success of the project will be evaluated based on the accuracy of sign language letter classification achieved by the CNN models. Key performance metrics include accuracy and loss, with the goal of maximizing accuracy while minimizing loss.

## Implementation
The project can be implemented using either PyTorch or TensorFlow over Google Colab.
